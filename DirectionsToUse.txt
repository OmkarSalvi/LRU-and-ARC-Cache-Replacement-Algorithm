My code which implements the ARC policy is Arc1.java & LRU policy is Lru1.java
This document uses Arc1.java as example to show how to compile and run it

For easier operation keep the trace files , java code files and script file in the same folder.

STEPS TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM:

1) To set the environment:
	instruction: #java
	
2) To Compile the java code:

	Compile the java code by typing the javac command below:
	
	SYNTAX : javac programfilename.java

	[username:~/filename/] javac Arc1.java 

	Assuming the file Arc1.java is in the current working directory, you should see no error messages.
	Now for each class defined in the code a ".class" file will be created in the current directory when code gets compiled correctly.
	
3) To run the java code:

	You will use the "java" command to execute the program.
	
	Type the java command as shown below.

	SYNTAX : [username:~/filename/] java -D cammandLine_argument1=Value1 -D cammandLine_argument2=Value2 class-name_which_has_main_function 
	
	# command Line argument1 : size-> cache size
	# command Line argument2 : file-> path to trace file name
	
	for example(cache size=1024 & trace=P4.lis) : java -Dsize=1024 -Dfile="/path_of _file/P4.lis" Arc1

	You should see the output of the program.
	
	
******* script file is written to run both LRU and ARC code for all cache size given in paper for trace file P4.lis ********

Steps to run script file ->

you will need to add the path for P4.lis file in script file i.e. run.sh for command line argument "file".

In submitted run.sh file I have written - java -Dsize=1024 -Dfile="P4.lis" Arc1
If P4.lis file is in same directory as the code and script file then no need to mention path. Just write P4.lis
for example:java -Dsize=1024 -Dfile="P4.lis" Arc1

If P4.lis is in another folder then in the command write the actual path of P4.lis file.
for example:java -Dsize=1024 -Dfile="/afs/asu.edu/users/o/s/a/osalvi/Desktop/P4.lis" Arc1


1) To set the environment:
	instruction :[username:~/filename/] #java

2) Get the permission to run script file 

Let the script file is run.sh and is in the current working directory.

	instruction :[username:~/filename/] chmod +x run.sh
	
3) Now we can run the script file

	instruction :[username:~/filename/] ./run.sh
	
Now the script file will run on the command Line and you can see the output of the program for different instances.
