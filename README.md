# LRU-and-ARC-Cache-Replacement-Algorithm

●	Implemented LRU and ARC cache replacement algorithm on real-life workloads in JAVA, compared the hit ratios of each algorithm for different cache sizes. 
●	The input traces capture disk accesses by databases, web servers, NT workstations, and a synthetic benchmark for storage controllers.
●	Algorithm used for ARC is explained in the paper "arcfast_paper.pdf" in current repository.
